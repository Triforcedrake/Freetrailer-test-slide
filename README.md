# Freetrailer-test-slide

The code for the second task in the Freetrailer Job Interview Test. 

I implemented a swiping unlock component using the "RN-Swipe-Button" package and linked it to a change in message and icon depending on the stage of swiping.

Testing has been carried out on a Motorola G8 Power android phone and running the program in expo should be as simple as extracting the files, running NPM Install and then using Expo Start.
